# jupyter
A collection of Jupyter notebooks (Python) that can be run interactively in your browser with the help of Binder.  Use the URL: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/peckhams/jupyter/master or click on the binder icon below.  These are currently very simple and experimental.

A graphical user interface (GUI) for the BALTO project that uses ipwidgets, ipyleaflet and pydap and runs in a Jupyter notebook is now available in the repo:  peckhams/BALTO_GUI.
